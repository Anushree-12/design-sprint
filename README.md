# design-sprint
A design exercise for using bootstrap. In groups of 2 - 4, make this site as **beautiful as possible** using _only_ bootstrap classes (i.e., **do not** write _any_ CSS). 

See the [examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/) and [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) for inspiration / details.

At the end of the activity, please share a screenshot on the #design channel on Slack.
